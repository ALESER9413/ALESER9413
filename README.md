## Hi, I'm Alejandro Sequeira <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> <br /> Full Stack Developer üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
## About Me
I would describe myself as a collaborative, passionate and creative software engineer with over 7 years of experience who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my seven years, I've worked with designers, developers, QAs, PM & DevOps which allowed me to hone my attention to detail and critical thinking skills as well as improve my communication skills working on team-based projects and with clients.

Over the years, I worked on several project teams using Javascript, Laravel, Nuxt, NodeJs, some AWS Services, and recently Backpack which helped me to design and develop complex systems.

If you want to know more about me, don't hesitate to contact me!
